I'm a Ph.D student in Economics at Michigan State University. My research focuses on the impact of women's representation in Mexican politics, specifically through three channels: first, if there is any difference in corruption across mayors of different genders; second, whether parties engage in strategic placement of female candidates when quotas are placed; and third, how increased female candidates impacts voters' decision at the ballot.
