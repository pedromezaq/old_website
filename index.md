I'm a Ph.D student in Economics at Michigan State University. My research focuses on the impact of women's representation in Mexican politics, specifically through three channels: first, if female mayors engage in more or less corruption compared to their male counterparts; second, whether parties engage in strategic placement of female candidates when quotas are placed; and third, increased female candidates and voters preferences.
